# Population Trends Analysis & Forecasting

A machine learning toolkit for analysing and predicting demographic changes using UN population data. This project brings together statistical forecasting methods with modern ML algorithms to help researchers and policymakers better understand population dynamics.

## What This Does

This project investigates the relationship between AI implementation and corporate sustainability outcomes. I developed this toolkit to take UN population datasets and apply several different forecasting approaches - from simple linear trends through to more sophisticated methods like polynomial fitting, exponential smoothing, and ensemble techniques using Random Forest and XGBoost. I designed the system to handle all the messy data cleaning work automatically, sort countries into sensible regional groups, and produce clear visualisations to help you understand what's happening.

Think of it as a comprehensive demographic analysis workshop that can predict where populations are heading, what factors drive density changes, and how different scenarios might play out over the next couple of decades. I built this because working with UN data can be frustrating - the formats are inconsistent, there's missing data everywhere, and you need multiple approaches to get reliable forecasts.

## Key Features

I included multiple ways of looking at population trends - linear projections for straightforward cases, polynomial fitting for more complex patterns, and exponential smoothing for time series analysis. I added machine learning models specifically designed for population density prediction, scenario analysis where you can test different growth assumptions, and robust data cleaning that handles the quirks of UN statistical formats. I made sure to include regional analysis to help you compare different parts of the world, and I built everything with fallback options so it'll work even if you haven't got all the optional packages installed.

To make the code output more visually appealing and engaging, I decided to try using icons and symbols throughout for the first time. This approach helps break up dense statistical text and makes it easier to spot key findings at a glance. The visual elements add some personality to what could otherwise be quite dry analytical output whilst keeping things professional.

## What You'll Need

### Essential Packages
You'll definitely need pandas for data handling, numpy for numerical work, matplotlib and seaborn for creating charts, scikit-learn for the machine learning bits, and scipy for statistical functions.

```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
scipy
```

### Optional Extras
If you want the full functionality, XGBoost gives you access to gradient boosting models (though it'll automatically fall back to the built-in gradient boosting if you haven't got it), and statsmodels provides more sophisticated time series analysis (with automatic fallback to polynomial methods if it's not available).

```
xgboost          # Falls back to Gradient Boosting if not available
statsmodels      # Falls back to polynomial methods if not available
```

## Getting Started

First, grab a copy of this repository and get the essential packages sorted. I made the installation as straightforward as possible:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
```

If you want the enhanced features:

```bash
pip install xgboost statsmodels
```

## Setting Up Your Data

I designed the script to work with UN population data in CSV format. You'll need to update the file path in the script to point to your data:

```python
FILE_PATH = r'your/path/to/population_data.csv'
```

The data should follow the standard UN format with country or region identifiers, year columns, population estimates (typically mid-year figures in millions), population density values, and the usual UN Statistical Yearbook structure. I've tested this extensively with the official UN datasets.

## How to Use It

### Running the Full Analysis

I made the simplest way to get started just running everything at once:

```python
results = run_full_analysis()
```

This will load and clean your data, build multiple forecasting models, work out how well they're performing, run scenario analyses for major countries, and store everything so you can explore the results further. I designed it to be completely automated - just point it at your data file and it does the rest.

### Creating Charts

I included functions to create trend plots for specific countries:

```python
plot_country_trends(results['data'], ['China', 'India', 'Brazil', 'Nigeria'])
```

Or generate comparisons between different forecasting methods:

```python
plot_forecasts(results['data'], 'India', years_ahead=15)
```

### Individual Forecasting Methods

If you want to use specific forecasting approaches, I made them available as individual functions:

**Linear trend projection:**
```python
forecast = simple_trend_forecast(data, 'Nigeria', years_ahead=10)
```

**Polynomial curve fitting:**
```python
poly_forecast = polynomial_forecast(data, 'Brazil', years_ahead=10, degree=2)
```

**Exponential smoothing (needs statsmodels):**
```python
exp_forecast = exponential_smoothing_forecast(data, 'China', years_ahead=10)
```

### Machine Learning Models

For population density prediction using Random Forest, I built this function:

```python
rf_model = build_random_forest_model(modeling_data)
print(f"Model RMSE: {rf_model['rmse']:.2f}")
```

XGBoost with automatic fallback to standard gradient boosting:

```python
xgb_model = build_xgboost_model(modeling_data)
```

### Scenario Planning

I included scenario analysis where you can test different growth assumptions:

```python
scenarios = {
    'conservative': -0.01,  # Growth slows by 1%
    'baseline': 0.0,        # Current trends continue
    'optimistic': 0.005     # Growth increases slightly
}

projections = scenario_analysis(data, 'Ethiopia', base_growth_rate=0.025, scenarios)
```

## Key Functions

I organised the code into logical groups:

**Data Processing:**
- `load_and_clean_data()` sorts out the quirks in UN data formats
- `prep_data_for_modeling()` gets your dataset ready for analysis

**Forecasting:**
- `simple_trend_forecast()` does straightforward linear extrapolation
- `polynomial_forecast()` fits curves to more complex patterns
- `exponential_smoothing_forecast()` applies time series smoothing techniques

**Machine Learning:**
- `build_random_forest_model()` uses ensemble methods for density prediction
- `build_xgboost_model()` provides gradient boosting with automatic fallback
- `build_gradient_boosting_model()` offers an alternative ensemble approach

**Analysis:**
- `scenario_analysis()` runs multiple demographic projections
- `plot_country_trends()` creates historical visualisations
- `plot_forecasts()` compares different forecasting methods

## How I've Organised It

I structured the project like this:

```
project/
├── population_analysis.py    # Main script with all the functions I wrote
├── README.md                # This documentation
├── requirements.txt         # List of dependencies
└── data/                   # Where you put your data files
    └── population_data.csv  # Your UN dataset goes here
```

## Understanding the Results

I included several ways to measure how well the forecasts are working:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** tells you the average difference between predictions and actual values
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** penalises bigger errors more heavily
- **R-squared** shows what proportion of the variance your trend models explain
- **Feature Importance** reveals which demographic variables matter most

## Regional Groupings

I set up automatic sorting of countries into regions for comparison:

- **Asia:** China, India, Japan, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia
- **Europe:** Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Poland, Ukraine, Netherlands, Belgium
- **Africa:** Nigeria, Ethiopia, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Uganda, Algeria, Morocco, Ghana
- **Americas:** United States, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Chile
- **Other:** Everything else that doesn't fit the main categories

## Tweaking the Settings

I made the main parameters easy to adjust in the script:

```python
# How far ahead to forecast
years_ahead = 10

# Model settings
n_estimators = 100
max_depth = 6
learning_rate = 0.1

# Data filtering
min_year = 1990
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Can't find the data file:** Double-check that the `FILE_PATH` variable points to where your data actually lives. I print the file path when the script runs so you can verify it.

**Character encoding problems:** I built the script to try UTF-8 and Latin-1 automatically, but if you've got a different encoding, you'll need to modify the `load_and_clean_data()` function.

**Missing packages:** I designed the core functionality to work without the optional dependencies. Install `xgboost` and `statsmodels` if you want all the bells and whistles.

**Data format doesn't work:** Make sure your data follows UN conventions with proper country names, years, and the right indicator columns. I built this specifically for UN Statistical Yearbook formats.

**Running out of memory:** If you're working with massive datasets, I included filtering options for specific regions or time periods.

## What to Keep in Mind

I built this with certain limitations in mind. Forecasting accuracy depends heavily on the quality and length of your historical data. The regional groupings I created are simplified and might not capture all the nuances. Long-term projections should be taken with a large pinch of salt - they're useful for understanding trends but shouldn't be treated as gospel. Model performance varies quite a bit depending on the country and how much data you've got.

## Contributing

I'd welcome contributions to make this better. Some areas that could use work include adding more forecasting algorithms, improving the regional classification system I set up, creating better visualisation options, handling missing data more elegantly, and optimising performance for large datasets.

## Data Sources

I designed this to work with UN Population Division datasets including the UN Statistical Yearbook population tables, World Population Prospects data, and Demographic and Social Statistics from the United Nations Statistics Division.

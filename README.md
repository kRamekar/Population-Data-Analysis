# Population Trends Analysis & Forecasting

A machine learning toolkit for analysing and predicting demographic changes using UN population data. This project brings together statistical forecasting methods with modern ML algorithms to help researchers and policymakers better understand population dynamics.

## What This Does

This toolkit takes UN population datasets and applies several different forecasting approaches - from simple linear trends through to more sophisticated methods like polynomial fitting, exponential smoothing, and ensemble techniques using Random Forest and XGBoost. The system handles all the messy data cleaning work automatically, sorts countries into sensible regional groups, and produces clear visualisations to help you understand what's happening.

## Key Features

The toolkit offers multiple ways of looking at population trends - linear projections for straightforward cases, polynomial fitting for more complex patterns, and exponential smoothing for time series analysis. There's also machine learning models specifically designed for population density prediction, scenario analysis where you can test different growth assumptions, and robust data cleaning that handles the quirks of UN statistical formats. Regional analysis helps you compare different parts of the world, and everything's built with fallback options so it'll work even if you haven't got all the optional packages installed.

## What You'll Need

### Essential Packages
You'll definitely need pandas for data handling, numpy for numerical work, matplotlib and seaborn for creating charts, scikit-learn for the machine learning bits, and scipy for statistical functions.

```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
scipy
```

### Optional Extras
If you want the full functionality, XGBoost gives you access to gradient boosting models (though it'll automatically fall back to the built-in gradient boosting if you haven't got it), and statsmodels provides more sophisticated time series analysis (with automatic fallback to polynomial methods if it's not available).

```
xgboost          # Falls back to Gradient Boosting if not available
statsmodels      # Falls back to polynomial methods if not available
```

## Getting Started

First, grab a copy of this repository and get the essential packages sorted:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
```

If you want the enhanced features:

```bash
pip install xgboost statsmodels
```

## Setting Up Your Data

The script works with UN population data in CSV format. You'll need to update the file path in the script to point to your data:

```python
FILE_PATH = r'your/path/to/population_data.csv'
```

The data should follow the standard UN format with country or region identifiers, year columns, population estimates (typically mid-year figures in millions), population density values, and the usual UN Statistical Yearbook structure.

## How to Use It

### Running the Full Analysis

The simplest way to get started is to run everything at once:

```python
results = run_full_analysis()
```

This will load and clean your data, build multiple forecasting models, work out how well they're performing, run scenario analyses for major countries, and store everything so you can explore the results further.

### Creating Charts

You can create trend plots for specific countries:

```python
plot_country_trends(results['data'], ['China', 'India', 'Brazil', 'Nigeria'])
```

Or generate comparisons between different forecasting methods:

```python
plot_forecasts(results['data'], 'India', years_ahead=15)
```

### Individual Forecasting Methods

If you want to use specific forecasting approaches, you can call them directly:

**Linear trend projection:**
```python
forecast = simple_trend_forecast(data, 'Nigeria', years_ahead=10)
```

**Polynomial curve fitting:**
```python
poly_forecast = polynomial_forecast(data, 'Brazil', years_ahead=10, degree=2)
```

**Exponential smoothing (needs statsmodels):**
```python
exp_forecast = exponential_smoothing_forecast(data, 'China', years_ahead=10)
```

### Machine Learning Models

For population density prediction using Random Forest:

```python
rf_model = build_random_forest_model(modeling_data)
print(f"Model RMSE: {rf_model['rmse']:.2f}")
```

XGBoost with automatic fallback to standard gradient boosting:

```python
xgb_model = build_xgboost_model(modeling_data)
```

### Scenario Planning

You can test different growth assumptions by defining multiple scenarios:

```python
scenarios = {
    'conservative': -0.01,
    'baseline': 0.0,
    'optimistic': 0.005
}

projections = scenario_analysis(data, 'Ethiopia', base_growth_rate=0.025, scenarios)
```

## Key Functions
